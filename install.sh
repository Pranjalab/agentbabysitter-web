# Bun gets special treatment because it's the one that stops people. Anthropic's
# Telegram plugin hardcodes `"command": "bun"` in its .mcp.json and runs
# server.ts directly, so there's no node fallback to fall back to. It's also the
# only dep that installs cleanly into $HOME with no sudo. Offer it; don't run
# someone else's installer unannounced just because they piped this to bash.
